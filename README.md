# Decelopment_of_Mixed-Mode_Strategy
Development of simulation-based strategy for mixed-mode operation of residential buildings. This repository contains all the program codes developed during the research for statistical analysis of the simulation results by OpenStudio-EnergyPlus. Also the code for mixed-mode assistance program along with the dataset to uploaded for the program
City_name.csv files are the results obtained from the simulation of the building model in the particular climatic condition. All these files must be uploaded on the python server like jupyter or colab before running the mixed-mode operation helping program. they can be extracted from the zip file named "Mixed_mode operation helping program.zip" 

Plotting_ASHRAE_55_&_IMAC file is the python code for all the statistical analysis and plotting the simulation results on the adaptive model graph. For the execution of the program, unzip the file named Data_set and upload all the files on your python server.

Climate analysis.zip file contains the 2 python programs and csv file dataset required for running the program. The csv dataset has been created by using the energyplus weather data files.
